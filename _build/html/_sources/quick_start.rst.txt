This guide is intended for running Singularity on a computer where you
have root (administrative) privileges. If you are learning about
Singularity on a system where you lack root privileges, you can still
complete the steps that do not require the sudo command. If you need to
request an installation on your shared resource, check out our requesting an installation help page for information to send to your
system administrator.

.. _installation:

------------
Installation
------------

There are many ways to :ref:`install Singularity <installation>` but this quick start guide will only cover one.

.. code-block:: none

    git clone https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git

    cd singularity

    ./autogen.sh

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    make

    sudo make install

Singularity must be installed as root to function properly.

-------------------------------------
Overview of the Singularity Interface
-------------------------------------

Singularity’s :ref:`command line interface <command-usage>` allows you to build and interact with containers
transparently. You can run programs inside a container as if they were
running on your host system. You can easily redirect IO, use pipes,
pass arguments, and access files, sockets, and ports on the host
system from within a container.
The ``--help`` option gives an overview of Singularity options and subcommands as
follows:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity --help

Singularity uses positional syntax. Global options follow the ``singularity``
invocation and affect the way that Singularity runs any command. Then
commands are passed followed by their options.
For example, to pass the ``--debug`` option to the main ``singularity`` command and run
Singularity with debugging messages on:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity --debug run shub://GodloveD/lolcow

And to pass the ``--containall`` option to the ``run`` command and run a Singularity image in an
isolated manner:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity run --containall shub://GodloveD/lolcow

To learn more about a specific Singularity command, type one of the
following:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity help <command>

    $ singularity --help <command>

    $ singularity -h <command>

    $ singularity <command> --help

    $ singularity <command> -h

Users can also :ref:`write help docs specific to a container <help>` or for an internal module called an ``app``. If those help
docs exist for a particular container, you can view them like so.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity help container.simg            # See the container's help, if provided

    $ singularity help --app foo container.simg  # See the help for foo, if provided

-------------------------
Download pre-built images
-------------------------

You can use the :ref:`pull <pull-command>` and :ref:`build <build-command>` commands to download pre-built images from an
external resource like `Singularity Hub <https://singularity-hub.org/>`_ or `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_. When called
on a native Singularity images like those provided on Singularity Hub, ``pull``
simply downloads the image file to your system.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity pull shub://vsoch/hello-world   # pull with default name, vsoch-hello-world-master.simg

    $ singularity pull --name hello.simg shub://vsoch/hello-world   # pull with custom name

Singularity images can also be pulled and named by an associated
GitHub commit or content hash.
You can also use ``pull`` with the ``docker://`` uri to reference Docker images served from a
registry. In this case ``pull`` does not just download an image file. Docker
images are stored in layers, so ``pull`` must also combine those layers into a
usable Singularity file.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity pull docker://godlovedc/lolcow  # with default name

    $ singularity pull --name funny.simg docker://godlovedc/lolcow # with custom name

Pulling Docker images reduces reproducibility. If you were to pull a
Docker image today and then wait six months and pull again, you are
not guaranteed to get the same image. If any of the source layers has
changed the image will be altered. If reproducibility is a priority
for you, try building your images from Singularity Hub.
You can also use the ``build`` command to download pre-built images from an
external resource. When using ``build`` you must specify a name for your
container like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity build hello-world.simg shub://vsoch/hello-world

    $ singularity build lolcow.simg docker://godlovedc/lolcow

Unlike ``pull``, ``build`` will convert your image to the latest Singularity image format
after downloading it.

``build`` is like a “Swiss Army knife” for container creation. In addition to
downloading images, you can use ``build`` to create images from other images or
from scratch using a `recipe file <container-recipes>`. You can also use ``build`` to convert an image between the
3 major container formats supported by Singularity. We discuss those
image formats below in the :ref:`Build images from scratch <build-images-from-scratch>` section.

--------------------
Interact with images
--------------------

Once you have an image, you can interact with it in several ways. For
these examples we will use a ``hello-world.simg`` image that can be downloaded from
Singularity Hub like so.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity pull --name hello-world.simg shub://vsoch/hello-world

Shell
=====

The :ref:`shell <shell-command>` command allows you to spawn a new shell within your container and
interact with it as though it were a small virtual machine.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell hello-world.simg

    Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...


    # I am the same user inside as outside!

    Singularity hello-world.simg:~/Desktop> whoami

    vanessa


    Singularity hello-world.simg:~/Desktop> id

    uid=1000(vanessa) gid=1000(vanessa) groups=1000(vanessa),4(adm),24,27,30(tape),46,113,128,999(input)

``shell`` also works with the ``shub://`` and ``docker://`` URIs. This creates an ephemeral container that
disappears when the shell is exited.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell shub://vsoch/hello-world

Executing Commands
==================

The :ref:`exec <exec>` command allows you to execute a custom command within a container by
specifying the image file. For instance, to list the root (/) of our
hello-world.simg image, we could do the following:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity exec hello-world.simg ls /

    anaconda-post.log  etc   lib64       mnt   root  singularity  tmp

    bin        home  lost+found  opt   run   srv          usr

    dev        lib   media       proc  sbin  sys          var

``exec`` also works with the ``shub://`` and ``docker://`` URIs. This creates an ephemeral container that
executes a command and disappears.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity exec shub://singularityhub/ubuntu cat /etc/os-release

Running a container
===================

Singularity containers contain :ref:`runscripts <runscript>`. These are user defined scripts that
define the actions a container should perform when someone runs it. The
runscript can be triggered with the run command, or simply by calling
the container as though it were an executable.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity run hello-world.simg

    $ ./hello-world.simg

``run`` also works with ``shub://`` and ``docker://`` URIs. This creates an ephemeral container that runs
and then disappears.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity run shub://GodloveD/lolcow

Working with Files
==================

Files on the host are reachable from within the container.

.. code-block:: none

    $ echo "Hello World" > $HOME/hello-kitty.txt

    $ singularity exec vsoch-hello-world-master.simg cat $HOME/hello-kitty.txt

    Hello World

This example works because ``hello-kitty.txt`` exists in the user’s home directory. By
default singularity bind mounts ``/home/$USER``, ``/tmp``, and ``$PWD`` into your container at
runtime.
You can specify additional directories to bind mount into your
container with the :ref:`- -bind <bind-paths-and-mounts>` option. In this example, the ``data`` directory on the host
system is bind mounted to the ``/mnt`` directory inside the container.

.. code-block:: none

    $ echo "I am your father" >/data/vader.sez

    $ ~/sing-dev/bin/singularity exec --bind /data:/mnt hello-world.simg cat /mnt/vader.sez

    I am your father

.. _build-images-from-scratch:

-------------------------
Build images from scratch
-------------------------

.. _sec:buildimagesfromscratch:

As of Singularity v2.4 by default ``build`` produces immutable images in the
squashfs file format. This ensures reproducible and verifiable images.
However, during testing and debugging you may want an image format
that is writable. This way you can ``shell`` into the image and install software
and dependencies until you are satisfied that your container will
fulfill your needs. For these scenarios, Singularity supports two
other image formats: a ``sandbox`` format (which is really just a chroot
directory), and a ``writable`` format (the ext3 file system that was used in
Singularity versions less than 2.4).

For more details about the different build options and best practices,
read about the :ref:`singularity flow <singularity-flow>`.

Sandbox Directory
=================

To build into a ``sandbox`` (container in a directory) use the ``build --sandbox`` command and option:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity build --sandbox ubuntu/ docker://ubuntu

This command creates a directory called ``ubuntu/`` with an entire Ubuntu
Operating System and some Singularity metadata in your current working
directory.
You can use commands like ``shell``, ``exec`` , and ``run`` with this directory just as you
would with a Singularity image. You can also write files to this
directory from within a Singularity session (provided you have the
permissions to do so). These files will be ephemeral and will
disappear when the container is finished executing. However if you use
the ``--writable`` option the changes will be saved into your directory so that you
can use them the next time you use your container.

Writable Image
==============

If you prefer to have a writable image file, you can ``build`` a container with
the ``--writable`` option.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity build --writable ubuntu.img docker://ubuntu

This produces an image that is writable with an ext3 file system.
Unlike the sandbox, it is a single image file. Also by convention this
file name has an “.img” extension instead of “.simg” .
When you want to alter your image, you can use commands like ``shell``, ``exec``, ``run``,
with the ``--writable`` option. Because of permission issues it may be necessary to
execute the container as root to modify it.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity shell --writable ubuntu.img

Converting images from one format to another
============================================

| The ``build`` command allows you to build a container from an existing
  container. This means that you can use it to convert a container from
  one format to another. For instance, if you have already created a
  sandbox (directory) and want to convert it to the default immutable
  image format (squashfs) you can do so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity build new-squashfs sandbox

Doing so may break reproducibility if you have altered your sandbox
outside of the context of a recipe file, so you are advised to
exercise care.
You can use ``build`` to convert containers to and from ``writable``, ``sandbox``, and default
(squashfs) file formats via any of the six possible combinations.

Singularity Recipes
===================

For a reproducible, production-quality container, we recommend that
you build a container with the default (squashfs) file format using a
Singularity recipe file. This also makes it easy to add files,
environment variables, and install custom software, and still start
from your base of choice (e.g., Singularity Hub).
A recipe file has a header and a body. The header determines what kind
of base container to begin with, and the body is further divided into
sections (called scriptlets) that do things like install software,
setup the environment, and copy files into the container from the host
system.
Here is an example of a recipe file:

.. code-block:: none


    Bootstrap: shub

    From: singularityhub/ubuntu


    %runscript

        exec echo "The runscript is the containers default runtime command!"


    %files

       /home/vanessa/Desktop/hello-kitty.txt        # copied to root of container

       /home/vanessa/Desktop/party_dinosaur.gif     /opt/the-party-dino.gif #


    %environment

        VARIABLE=MEATBALLVALUE

        export VARIABLE


    %labels

       AUTHOR vsochat@stanford.edu


    %post

        apt-get update && apt-get -y install python3 git wget

        mkdir /data

        echo "The post section is where you can install, and configure your container."


To build a container from this definition file (assuming it is a file
named Singularity), you would call build like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity build ubuntu.simg Singularity

In this example, the header tells singularity to use a base Ubuntu
image from Singularity Hub. The ``%runscript`` section defines actions for the
container to take when it is executed (in this case a simple message).
The ``%files`` section copies some files into the container from the host system
at build time. The ``%environment`` section defines some environment variables that
will be available to the container at runtime. The ``%labels`` section allows for
custom metadata to be added to the container. And finally the ``%post`` section
executes within the container at build time after the base OS has been
installed. The ``%post`` section is therefore the place to perform installations
of custom apps.
This is a very small example of the things that you can do with a :ref:`recipe file <container-recipes>` . In
addition to building a container from Singularity Hub, you can start
with base images from Docker Hub, use images directly from official
repositories such as Ubuntu, Debian, Centos, Arch, and BusyBox, use an
existing container on your host system as a base, or even take a
snapshot of the host system itself and use that as a base image.
If you want to build Singularity images without having singularity
installed in a build environment, you can build images using
`Singularity Hub <https://github.com/singularityhub/singularityhub.github.io/wiki>`__
instead. If you want a more detailed rundown and examples for
different build options, see our :ref:`singularity flow <singularity-flow>` page.
