Singularity Flow
================

This document describes a suggested “best-practices” workflow for
building, running, and managing your containers.

There are generally two ways to get images. You either want to pull an
image file as is, or (more likely) build your own custom image. We
will start with talking about build, and the many different use cases it affords.

Building Images
---------------

If you read the :ref:`quick start <quick-start>`, you probably remember that building images from a
Docker base does not require a :ref:`Singularity recipe <container-recipes>`. However, if you do want to build and
customize your image, you can create a :ref:`Singularity recipe <container-recipes>` text file, which is a simple
text file that describes how the container should be made.

The Singularity Flow
====================

The diagram below is a visual depiction of how you can use Singularity
to build images. The high level idea is that we have two environments:

-  a **build** environment (where you have sudo privileges) to test and
   build your container

-  a **production** environment where you run your container

   Singularity Workflow

Singularity production images are immutable. This is a feature added as
of Singularity 2.4, and it ensures a higher level of reproducibility and
verification of images. To read more about the details, check out the :ref:`build <build-a-container>`
docs. However, immutability is not so great when you are testing,
debugging, or otherwise want to quickly change your image. We will
proceed by describing a typical workflow of developing first, building a
final image, and using it in production.

1. Development Commands
=======================

If you want a writable image or folder for developing, you have two
options:

-  build into a directory that has writable permissions using the ``--sandbox`` option

-  build into an ext3 image file, that has writable permissions with the ``--writable``
   option

In both cases you will need to execute your container with the ``--writable`` option at
runtime for your changes to be persistent.

Sandbox Folder
--------------

To build into a folder (we call this a “sandbox”) just ask for it:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity build --sandbox ubuntu/ docker://ubuntu

    Docker image path: index.docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest

    Cache folder set to /root/.singularity/docker

    Importing: base Singularity environment

    Importing: /root/.singularity/docker/sha256:9fb6c798fa41e509b58bccc5c29654c3ff4648b608f5daa67c1aab6a7d02c118.tar.gz

    Importing: /root/.singularity/docker/sha256:3b61febd4aefe982e0cb9c696d415137384d1a01052b50a85aae46439e15e49a.tar.gz

    Building image from sandbox: ubuntu/

    Singularity container built: ubuntu/


We now have a folder with the entire ubuntu OS, plus some Singularity
metadata, plopped in our present working directory.

.. code-block:: none

     $ tree -L 1 ubuntu

    ubuntu

    ├── bin

    ├── boot

    ├── dev

    ├── environment -> .singularity.d/env/90-environment.sh

    ├── etc

    ├── home

    ├── lib

    ├── lib64

    ├── media

    ├── mnt

    ├── opt

    ├── proc

    ├── root

    ├── run

    ├── sbin

    ├── singularity -> .singularity.d/runscript

    ├── srv

    ├── sys

    ├── tmp

    ├── usr

    └── var

And you can shell into it just like a normal container.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell ubuntu

    Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...


    Singularity ubuntu:~/Desktop> touch /hello.txt

    touch: cannot touch '/hello.txt': Permission denied


You can make changes to the container (assuming you have the proper
permissions to do so) but those changes will disappear as soon as you
exit. To make your changes persistent across sessions, use the ``--writable`` option.
It’s also a good practice to shell into your container as root to
ensure you have permissions to write where you like.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity shell ubuntu

    Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...


    Singularity ubuntu:/home/vanessa/Desktop> touch /hello.txt


Writable Image
--------------

If you prefer to work with a writable image file rather than a
directory, you can perform a similar development build and specify the ``--writable``
option. This will produce an image that is writable with an ext3 file
system. Unlike the sandbox, it is a single image file.

.. code-block:: none


    $ sudo singularity build --writable ubuntu.img docker://ubuntu

    Docker image path: index.docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest

    Cache folder set to /root/.singularity/docker

    Singularity container built: ubuntu.img


You can use this image with commands like ``shell``, ``exec`` , ``run`` , and if you want to
change the image you must use the ``--writable`` flag. As before, it’s a good idea to
issue these commands as root to ensure you have the proper permissions
to write.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity shell --writable ubuntu.img


    Development Tip! When building containers, it often is the case that

    you will have a lot of testing of installation commands, and if

    building a production image, one error will stop the entire build.

    If you interactively write the build recipe with one of these

    writable containers, you can debug as you go, and then build the

    production (squashfs) container without worrying that it will error

    and need to be started again.

2. Production Commands
======================

Let’s set the scene - we just finished building our perfect hello world
container. It does a fantastic hello-world analysis, and we have written
a paper on it! We now want to build an immutable container - meaning
that if someone obtained our container and tried to change it, they
could not. They could easily use the same recipe that you used (it is
provided as metadata inside the container), or convert your container to
one of the writable formats above using ``build`` . So your work can still be
extended.

Recommended Production Build
----------------------------

What we want for production is a build into a `squashfs image <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS>`_ .
Squashfs is a read only, and compressed filesystem, and well suited for
confident archive and re-use of your hello-world. To build a production
image, just remove the extra options:

.. code-block:: none

    sudo singularity build ubuntu.simg docker://ubuntu

    Docker image path: index.docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest

    Cache folder set to /root/.singularity/docker

    Importing: base Singularity environment

    Singularity container built: ubuntu.simg


Production Build from Sandbox
-----------------------------

We understand that it might be wanted to build a Singularity (squashfs)
from a previous development image. While we advocate for the first
approach, we support this use case. To do this, given our folder called
“ubuntu/” we made above:

.. code-block:: none

    sudo singularity build ubuntu.simg ubuntu/

It could be the case that a cluster maintains a “working” base of
container folders (with writable) and then builds and provides
production containers to its users.

If you want to go through this entire process without having
singularity installed locally, or without leaving your cluster, you
can build images using `Singularity Hub <https://github.com/singularityhub/singularityhub.github.io/wiki>`_.
