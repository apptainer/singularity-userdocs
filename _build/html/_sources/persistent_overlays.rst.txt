===================
Persistent Overlays
===================

Persistent overlay images are new to version 2.4! This feature allows
you to overlay a writable file system on an immutable read-only
container for the illusion of read-write access.

--------
Overview
--------

A persistent overlay is an image that “sits on top” of your
compressed, immutable squashfs container. When you install new
software or create and modify files the overlay image stores the
changes.

In Singularity versions 2.4 and later an overlay file system is
automatically added to your squashfs or sandbox container when it is
mounted. This means you can install new software and create and modify
files even though your container is read-only. But your changes will disappear as soon as you exit the container.

If you want your changes to persist in your container across uses, you
can create a writable image to use as a persistent overlay. Then you
can specify that you want to use the image as an overlay at runtime
with the ``--overlay`` option.

You can use a persistent overlays with the following commands:

- ``run``
- ``exec``
- ``shell``
- ``instance.start``

-----
Usage
-----

To use a persistent overlay, you must first have a container.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity build ubuntu.simg shub://GodloveD/ubuntu

Then you must create a writable, ext3 image. We can do so with the ``image.create``
command:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity image.create my-overlay.img

Now you can use this overlay image with your container. Note that it is
not necessary to be root to use an overlay partition, but this will
ensure that we have write privileges where we want them.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity shell --overlay my-overlay.img ubuntu.simg

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> touch /foo

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> apt-get install -y vim

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> which vim

    /usr/bin/vim

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> exit


You will find that your changes persist across sessions as though you
were using a writable container.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity shell --overlay my-overlay.img ubuntu.simg

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> ls /foo

    /foo

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> which vim

    /usr/bin/vim

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> exit


If you mount your container without the ``--overlay`` option, your changes will be
gone.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity shell ubuntu.simg

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> ls /foo

    ls: cannot access 'foo': No such file or directory

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> which vim

    Singularity ubuntu.simg:~> exit
