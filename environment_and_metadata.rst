Singularity containers support environment variables and labels that you
can add to your container during the build process. This page details
general information about defining environments and labels. If you are looking for specific environment variables for build time, see build
environment.

-----------
Environment
-----------

If you build a container from Singularity Hub or Docker Hub, the
environment will be included with the container at build time. You can
also define custom environment variables in your Recipe file like so:

.. code-block:: none

    Bootstrap: shub

    From: vsoch/hello-world


    %environment

        VARIABLE_NAME=VARIABLE_VALUE

        export VARIABLE_NAME

You may need to add environment variables to your container during the
``%post`` section. For instance, maybe you will not know the appropriate
value of a variable until you have installed some software.
To add variables to the environment during ``%post`` you can use the
``$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT`` variable with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: none

    %post

        echo 'export VARIABLE_NAME=VARIABLE_VALUE' >>$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT

Text in the ``%environment`` section will be appended to the file ``/.singularity.d/env/90-environment.sh`` while text redirected
to ``$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT`` will end up in the file /.singularity.d/env/91-environment.sh.

Because files in ``/.singularity.d/env`` are sourced in alpha-numerical order, this means that
variables added using ``$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT`` take precedence over those added via the ``%environment``
section.

Need to define a variable at runtime? You can set variables inside the
container by prefixing them with ``SINGULARITYENV_``. They will be
transposed automatically and the prefix will be stripped. For example,
let’s say we want to set the variable ``HELLO`` to have value ``WORLD``. We can do that
as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    $ SINGULARITYENV_HELLO=WORLD singularity exec --cleanenv centos7.img env

    HELLO=WORLD

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64

    SINGULARITY_NAME=test.img

    PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

    PWD=/home/gmk/git/singularity

    LANG=en_US.UTF-8

    SHLVL=0

    SINGULARITY_INIT=1

    SINGULARITY_CONTAINER=test.img


Notice the ``--cleanenv`` in the example above? That argument specifies that we want
to remove the host environment from the container. If we remove the ``--cleanenv``,
we will still pass forward ``HELLO=WORLD``, and the list shown above, but we will
also pass forward all the other environment variables from the host.

If you need to change the $PATH of your container at runtime there are
a few environmental variables you can use:

-  ``SINGULARITYENV_PREPEND_PATH=/good/stuff/at/beginning`` to prepend directories to the beginning of the

-  ``SINGULARITYENV_APPEND_PATH=/good/stuff/at/end`` to append directories to the end of the

-  ``SINGULARITYENV_PATH=/a/new/path`` to override the ``$PATH`` within the container

------
Labels
------

Your container stores metadata about it’s build, along with Docker
labels, and custom labels that you define during build in a ``%labels`` section.

For containers that are generated with Singularity version 2.4 and
later, labels are represented using the `rc1 Label Schema <http://label-schema.org/rc1/>`_. For
example:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity inspect dino.img

    {

        "org.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.bootstrap": "docker",

        "MAINTAINER": "Vanessasaurus",

        "org.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile": "Singularity.help",

        "org.label-schema.usage": "/.singularity.d/runscript.help",

        "org.label-schema.schema-version": "1.0",

        "org.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.from": "ubuntu:latest",

        "org.label-schema.build-date": "2017-07-28T22:59:17-04:00",

        "org.label-schema.usage.singularity.runscript.help": "/.singularity.d/runscript.help",

        "org.label-schema.usage.singularity.version": "2.3.1-add/label-schema.g00f040f",

        "org.label-schema.build-size": "715MB"

    }

You will notice that the one label doesn’t belong to the label schema, ``MAINTAINER`` .
This was a user provided label during bootstrap. Finally, for
Singularity versions >= 2.4, the image build size is added as a label, ``org.label-schema.build-size``,
and the label schema is used throughout. For versions earlier than 2.4,
containers did not use the label schema, and looked like this:

.. code-block:: none

    singularity exec centos7.img cat /.singularity.d/labels.json

    { "name":

          "CentOS Base Image",

           "build-date": "20170315",

           "vendor": "CentOS",

           "license": "GPLv2"

    }

You can add custom labels to your container in a bootstrap file:

.. code-block:: none

    Bootstrap: docker

    From: ubuntu: latest



    %labels

The ``inspect`` command is useful for viewing labels and other container meta-data.

------------------
Container Metadata
------------------

Inside of the container, metadata is stored in the ``/.singularity.d`` directory. You
probably shouldn’t edit any of these files directly but it may be
helpful to know where they are and what they do:

.. code-block:: none

    /.singularity.d/


    ├── actions

    │   ├── exec

    │   ├── run

    │   ├── shell

    │   ├── start

    │   └── test

    ├── env

    │   ├── 01-base.sh

    └── startscript

-  **actions**: This directory contains helper scripts to allow the
   container to carry out the action commands.

-  **env**: All \*.sh files in this directory are sourced in
   alpha-numeric order when the container is initiated. For legacy
   purposes there is a symbolic link called ``/environment`` that points to ``/.singularity.d/env/90-environment.sh``.

-  **labels.json**: The json file that stores a containers labels
   described above.

-  **libs**: At runtime the user may request some host-system libraries
   to be mapped into the container (with the ``--nv`` option for example). If so,
   this is their destination.

-  **runscript**: The commands in this file will be executed when the
   container is invoked with the ``run`` command or called as an executable. For
   legacy purposes there is a symbolic link called ``/singularity`` that points to this
   file

-  **Singularity**: This is the Recipe file that was used to generate
   the container. If more than 1 Recipe file was used to generate the
   container additional Singularity files will appear in numeric order
   in a sub-directory called ``bootstrap_history``

-  **startscript**: The commands in this file will be executed when the
   container is invoked with the ``instance.start`` command.
