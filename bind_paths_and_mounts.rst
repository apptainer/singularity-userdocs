Bind Paths and Mounts

If `enabled by the system administrator <https://singularity-admindoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the_singularity_config_file.html#user-bind-control-boolean-default-yes>`_, Singularity allows you to map
directories on your host system to directories within your container
using bind mounts. This allows you to read and write data on the host
system with ease.

--------
Overview
--------

When Singularity ‘swaps’ the host operating system for the one inside
your container, the host file systems becomes inaccessible. But you may
want to read and write files on the host system from within the
container. To enable this functionality, Singularity will bind
directories back in via two primary methods: system-defined bind points
and conditional user-defined bind points.


System-defined bind points
==========================

The system administrator has the ability to define what bind points will
be included automatically inside each container. The bind paths are
locations on the host’s root file system which should also be visible
within the container. Some of the bind paths are automatically derived
(e.g. a user’s home directory) and some are statically defined (e.g.
bind path in the Singularity configuration file). In the default
configuration, the directories ``$HOME`` , ``/tmp`` , ``/proc`` , ``/sys`` , ``/dev`` and are among the system-defined
bind points.

User-defined bind points
========================

If the system administrator has `enabled user control of binds <https://singularity-admindoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the_singularity_config_file.html#user-bind-control-boolean-default-yes>`_, you
will be able to request your own bind points within your container.

To *mount* a bind path inside the container, a **bind point** must be
defined within the container. The bind point is a directory within the
container that Singularity can use to bind a directory on the host
system. This means that if you want to bind to a point within the
container such as ``/global``, that directory must already exist within the
container.

It is, however, possible that the system administrator has enabled a
Singularity feature called `overlay in the Singularity configuration
file <https://singularity-admindoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the_singularity_config_file.html#enable-overlay-boolean-default-no>`_. This will cause the bind points to be created on an as-needed
basis in an overlay file system so that the underlying container is
not modified. But because the overlay feature is not always enabled or
is unavailable in the kernels of some older host systems, it may be
necessary for container standards to exist to ensure portability from
host to host.

Specifying Bind Paths
---------------------

Many of the Singularity commands such as ``run``, ``exec`` , and ``shell`` take the ``--bind /
command-line`` option to specify bind paths, in addition to the ``SINGULARITY_BINDPATH``
environment variable. This option’s argument is a comma-delimited
string of bind path specifications in the format ``src[:dest[:opts]]``, where ``src`` and ``dest`` are
outside and inside paths. If ``dest`` is not given, it is set equal to ``src`` . Mount
options (``opts``) may be specified as ``ro`` (read-only) or ``rw`` (read/write, which is
the default). The ``--bind/-B`` option can be specified multiple times, or a
comma-delimited string of bind path specifications can be used.

Here’s an example of using the ``-B`` option and binding ``/tmp`` on the host to ``/scratch`` in
the container (``/scratch`` does not need to already exist in the container if
file system overlay is enabled):

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell -B /tmp:/scratch /tmp/Centos7-ompi.img

    Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...


    Singularity.Centos7-ompi.img> ls /scratch

    ssh-7vywtVeOez  systemd-private-cd84c81dda754fe4a7a593647d5a5765-ntpd.service-12nMO4

You can bind multiple directories in a single command with this
syntax:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell -B /opt,/data:/mnt /tmp/Centos7-ompi.img

This will bind ``/opt`` on the host to ``/opt`` in the container and ``/data`` on the host to ``/mnt`` in the
container. Using the environment variable instead of the command line
argument, this would be:

.. code-block:: none

    $ export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="/opt,/data:/mnt"

    $ singularity shell /tmp/Centos7-ompi.img

Using the environment variable ``$SINGULARITY_BINDPATH``, you can bind directories even when you
are running your container as an executable file with a runscript. If
you bind many directories into your Singularity containers and they
don’t change, you could even benefit by setting this variable in your ``.bashrc``
file.

Binding with Overlay
--------------------

If a bind path is requested and the bind point does not exist within the
container, a warning message will be displayed and Singularity will
continue trying to start the container. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell --bind /global /tmp/Centos7-ompi.img

    WARNING: Non existent bind point (directory) in container: '/global'

    Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...


    Singularity.Centos7-ompi.img>

Even though ``/global`` did not exist inside the container, the shell command
printed a warning but continued on. If overlay is available and enabled,
you will find that we no longer get the error and ``/global`` is created and
accessible as expected:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell --bind /global /tmp/Centos7-ompi.img

    Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...


    Singularity.Centos7-ompi.img>

In this case, Singularity dynamically created the necessary bind point
in your container. Without overlay, you would have needed to manually
create the ``/global`` directory inside your container.
