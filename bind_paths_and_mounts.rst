Bind Paths and Mounts
=====================

.. _sec:bindpaths:

If `enabled by the system administrator <https://singularity-admindoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the_singularity_config_file.html#user-bind-control-boolean-default-yes>`_,
Singularity allows you to map directories on your host system to directories
within your container using bind mounts. This allows you to read and write data
on the host system with ease.


--------
Overview
--------

When Singularity ‘swaps’ the host operating system for the one inside your
container, the host file systems becomes inaccessible. But you may want to read
and write files on the host system from within the container. To enable this
functionality, Singularity will bind directories back into the container via two
primary methods: system-defined bind paths and user-defined bind paths.

-------------------------
System-defined bind paths
-------------------------

The system administrator has the ability to define what bind paths will be
included automatically inside each container. Some bind paths are automatically
derived (e.g. a user’s home directory) and some are statically defined (e.g.
bind paths in the Singularity configuration file). In the default
configuration, the system default bind points are ``$HOME`` , ``/sys:/sys`` ,
``/proc:/proc``, ``/tmp:/tmp``, ``/var/tmp:/var/tmp``, ``/etc/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf``,
``/etc/passwd:/etc/passwd``, and ``$PWD``. Where the first path before ``:``
is the path from the host and the second path is the path in the container.

Disabling System Binds
======================

The ``--no-mount`` flag, added in Singularity 3.7, allows specific
system mounts to be disabled, even if they are set in the
``singularity.conf`` configuration file by the administrator.

For example, if Singularity has been configured with ``mount hostfs =
yes`` then every filesystem on the host will be bind mounted to the
container by default. If, e.g. a ``/project`` filesystem on your host
conflicts with a ``/project`` directory in the container you are
running, you can disable the ``hostfs`` binds:

.. code:: console

    $ singularity run --no-mount hostfs mycontainer.sif

    
Multiple mounts can be disabled by specifying them separated by
commas:

.. code:: console

    $ singularity run --no-mount tmp,sys,dev mycontainer.sif

-----------------------
User-defined bind paths
-----------------------

If the system administrator has `enabled user control of binds <https://singularity-admindoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the_singularity_config_file.html#user-bind-control-boolean-default-yes>`_,
you will be able to request your own bind paths within your container.

The Singularity action commands (``run``, ``exec``, ``shell``, and
``instance start``) will accept the ``--bind/-B`` command-line option to specify
bind paths, and will also honor the ``$SINGULARITY_BIND`` (or
``$SINGULARITY_BINDPATH``) environment variable. The argument for this option is
a comma-delimited string of bind path specifications in the format
``src[:dest[:opts]]``, where ``src`` and ``dest`` are paths outside and inside
of the container respectively. If ``dest`` is not given, it is set equal to
``src``. Mount options (``opts``) may be specified as ``ro`` (read-only) or
``rw`` (read/write, which is the default). The ``--bind/-B`` option can be
specified multiple times, or a comma-delimited string of bind path
specifications can be used.

Specifying bind paths
=====================

Here’s an example of using the ``--bind`` option and binding ``/data`` on the
host to ``/mnt`` in the container (``/mnt`` does not need to already exist in
the container):

.. code-block:: none

    $ ls /data
    bar  foo

    $ singularity exec --bind /data:/mnt my_container.sif ls /mnt
    bar  foo

You can bind multiple directories in a single command with this syntax:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell --bind /opt,/data:/mnt my_container.sif

This will bind ``/opt`` on the host to ``/opt`` in the container and ``/data``
on the host to ``/mnt`` in the container.

Using the environment variable instead of the command line argument, this would
be:

.. code-block:: none

    $ export SINGULARITY_BIND="/opt,/data:/mnt"

    $ singularity shell my_container.sif

Using the environment variable ``$SINGULARITY_BIND``, you can bind paths even
when you are running your container as an executable file with a runscript. If
you bind many directories into your Singularity containers and they don’t
change, you could even benefit by setting this variable in your ``.bashrc``
file.


A note on using ``--bind`` with the ``--writable`` flag
=======================================================

To mount a bind path inside the container, a *bind point* must be defined
within the container. The bind point is a directory within the container that
Singularity can use as a destination to bind a directory on the host system.

Starting in version 3.0, Singularity will do its best to bind mount requested
paths into a container regardless of whether the appropriate bind point exists
within the container.  Singularity can often carry out this operation even in
the absence of the "overlay fs" feature.

However, binding paths to non-existent points within the container can result in
unexpected behavior when used in conjuction with the ``--writable`` flag, and is
therefore disallowed. If you need to specify bind paths in combination with the
``--writable`` flag, please ensure that the appropriate bind points exist within
the container. If they do not already exist, it will be necessary to modify the
container and create them.


Using ``--no-home`` and ``--containall`` flags
==============================================

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``--no-home``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When shelling into your container image, Singularity allows you to mount your current working directory (``CWD``)
without mounting your host ``$HOME`` directory with the ``--no-home`` flag.

.. code-block:: none

      $ singularity shell --no-home my_container.sif

.. note::

    Beware that if it is the case that your ``CWD`` is your ``$HOME`` directory, it will still mount your ``$HOME`` directory.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``--containall``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Using the ``--containall`` (or ``-C`` for short) flag, ``$HOME`` is not  mounted and a dummy bind mount is created at the ``$HOME`` point.
    You cannot use ``-B``` (or ``--bind``) to bind your ``$HOME`` directory because it creates an empty mount. So if you have files located in
    the image at ``/home/user``, the ``--containall`` flag will hide them all.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell --containall my_container.sif


-----------
FUSE mounts
-----------

Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is an interface to allow filesystems to
be mounted using code that runs in userspace, rather than in the Linux
Kernel. Unprivileged (non-root) users can mount filesystems that have
FUSE drivers. For example, the ``fuse-sshfs`` package allows you to
mount a remote computer's filesystem to your local host, over ssh:

.. code-block:: none

    $ mount.fuse sshfs#ythel:/home/dave other_host/

    # Now mounted to my local machine:
    $ ythel:/home/dave on /home/dave/other_host type fuse.sshfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1000,group_id=1000)


Singularity 3.6 introduces the ``--fusemount`` option, which allows
you directly expose FUSE filesystems inside a container. The FUSE
command / driver that mounts a particular type of filesystem can be
located on the host, or in the container.

The FUSE command *must* be based on libfuse3 to work correctly with
Singularity ``--fusemount``. If you are using an older distribution
that provides FUSE commands such as ``sshfs`` based on FUSE 2 then you
can install FUSE 3 versions of the commands you need inside your
container.


.. note::

   ``--fusemount`` functionality was present in a hidden preview state
   from Singularity 3.4. The behavior has changed for the final
   supported version introduced in Singularity 3.6.


   
FUSE mount definitions
======================

A fusemount definition for Singularity consists of 3 parts:

.. code-block:: none

    --fusemount <type>:<fuse command> <container mountpoint>


- **type** specifies how and where the FUSE mount will be run. The options are:
  
  - ``container`` - use a FUSE command on the host, to mount a
    filesystem into the container, with the fuse process attached.
  - ``host`` - use a FUSE command inside the container, to mount a
    filesystem into the container, with the fuse process attached.
  - ``container-daemon`` - use a FUSE command on the host, to mount a
    filesystem into the container, with the fuse process detached.
  - ``host-daemon`` - use a FUSE command inside the container, to
    mount a filesystem into the container, with the fuse process
    detached.

- **fuse command** specifies the name of the executable that
  implements the FUSE mount, and any arguments. E.g. ``sshfs
  server:over-there/`` for mounting a remote filesystem over SSH,
  where the remote source is ``over-there/`` in my home directory on
  the machine called ``server``.

- **container mountpoint** is an *absolute path* at which the FUSE
  filesystem will be mounted in the container.
  
    
FUSE mount with a host executable
=================================

To use a FUSE ``sshfs`` mount in a container, where the ``fuse-sshfs`` package has
been installed on my host, I run with the ``host`` mount type:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity run --fusemount "host:sshfs server:/ /server" docker://ubuntu
    Singularity> cat /etc/hostname 
    localhost.localdomain
    Singularity> cat /server/etc/hostname
    server

FUSE mount with a container executable
======================================

If the FUSE driver / command that you want to use for the mount has
been added to your container, you can use the ``container`` mount
type:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity run --fusemount "container:sshfs server:/ /server" sshfs.sif
    Singularity> cat /etc/hostname 
    localhost.localdomain
    Singularity> cat /server/etc/hostname
    server
