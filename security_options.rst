Singularity 3.0 introduces many new security related options to the container
runtime.  This document will describe the new methods users have for specifying
the security scope and context when running Singularity containers.


------------------
Linux Capabilities
------------------

.. note::
     It is extremely important to recognize that **granting users Linux
     capabilities with the** ``capability`` **command group is usually identical
     to granting those users root level access on the host system**. Most if not
     all capabilities will allow users to "break out" of the container and
     become root on the host. This feature is targeted toward special use cases
     (like cloud-native architectures) where an admin/developer might want to
     limit the attack surface within a container that normally runs as root.
     This is not a good option in multi-tenant HPC environments where an admin
     wants to grant a user special privileges within a container. For that and
     similar use cases, the :ref:`fakeroot feature <fakeroot>` is a better
     option.

Singularity provides full support for granting and revoking Linux capabilities
on a user or group basis.  For example, let us suppose that an admin has
decided to grant a user (named ``pinger``) capabilities to open raw sockets so
that they can use ``ping`` in a container where the binary is controlled via
capabilities. For information about how to manage capabilities as an admin
please refer to the
`capability admin docs <\{admindocbaseurl\}/\{adminversion\}/configfiles.html#capability.json>`_.


To take advantage of this granted capability as a user, ``pinger`` must also
request the capability when executing a container with the ``--add-caps`` flag
like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity exec --add-caps CAP_NET_RAW library://sylabs/tests/ubuntu_ping:v1.0 ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
    PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=73.1 ms

    --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 73.178/73.178/73.178/0.000 ms

If the admin decides that it is no longer necessary to allow the user
``pinger`` to open raw sockets within Singularity containers, they can revoke
the appropriate Linux capability and ``pinger`` will not be able to add that
capability to their containers anymore:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity exec --add-caps CAP_NET_RAW library://sylabs/tests/ubuntu_ping:v1.0 ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
    WARNING: not authorized to add capability: CAP_NET_RAW
    ping: socket: Operation not permitted


Another scenario which is atypical of shared resource environments, but useful
in cloud-native architectures is dropping capabilities when spawning containers
as the root user to help minimize attack surfaces. With a default installation
of Singularity, containers created by the root user will maintain all
capabilities. This behavior is configurable if desired. Check out the
`capability configuration <\{admindocbaseurl\}/\{adminversion\}/configfiles.html#capability.json>`_
and `root default capabilities <\{admindocbaseurl\}/\{adminversion\}/configfiles.html#setuid-and-capabilities>`_
sections of the admin docs for more information.

Assuming the root user will execute containers with the ``CAP_NET_RAW``
capability by default, executing the same container ``pinger`` executed above
works without the need to grant capabilities:

.. code-block:: none

    # singularity exec library://sylabs/tests/ubuntu_ping:v1.0 ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
    PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=59.6 ms

    --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 59.673/59.673/59.673/0.000 ms

Now we can manually drop the ``CAP_NET_RAW`` capability like so:

.. code-block:: none

    # singularity exec --drop-caps CAP_NET_RAW library://sylabs/tests/ubuntu_ping:v1.0 ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
    ping: socket: Operation not permitted

And now the container will not have the ability to create new sockets, causing
the ``ping`` command to fail.

The ``--add-caps`` and ``--drop-caps`` options will accept the ``all`` keyword.
Of course appropriate caution should be exercised when using this keyword.

-----------------------------
Building encrypted containers
-----------------------------
Beginning in Singularity 3.4.0 it is possible to build and run encrypted
containers.  The containers are decrypted at runtime entirely in kernel space,
meaning that no intermediate decrypted data is ever present on disk. See
:ref:`encrypted containers <encryption>` for more details.


-------------------------------
Security related action options
-------------------------------

Singularity 3.0 introduces many new flags that can be passed to the action
commands; ``shell``, ``exec``, and ``run`` allowing fine grained control of
security.


``--add-caps``
==============

As explained above, ``--add-caps`` will "activate" Linux capabilities when a
container is initiated, providing those capabilities have been granted to the
user by an administrator using the ``capability add`` command. This option will
also accept the case insensitive keyword ``all`` to add every capability
granted by the administrator.


``--allow-setuid``
==================

The SetUID bit allows a program to be executed as the user that owns the binary.
The most well-known SetUID binaries are owned by root and allow a user to
execute a command with elevated privileges.  But other SetUID binaries may
allow a user to execute a command as a service account.

By default SetUID is disallowed within Singularity containers as a security
precaution.  But the root user can override this precaution and allow SetUID
binaries to behave as expected within a Singularity container with the
``--allow-setuid`` option like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity shell --allow-setuid some_container.sif


``--keep-privs``
================

It is possible for an admin to set a different set of default capabilities or to
reduce the default capabilities to zero for the root user by setting the ``root
default capabilities`` parameter in the ``singularity.conf`` file to ``file`` or
``no`` respectively.  If this change is in effect, the root user can override
the ``singularity.conf`` file and enter the container with full capabilities
using the ``--keep-privs`` option.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity exec --keep-privs library://centos ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
    PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=18.8 ms

    --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 18.838/18.838/18.838/0.000 ms


``--drop-caps``
================

By default, the root user has a full set of capabilities when they enter the
container. You may choose to drop specific capabilities when you initiate a
container as root to enhance security.

For instance, to drop the ability for the root user to open a raw socket inside
the container:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity exec --drop-caps CAP_NET_RAW library://centos ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
    ping: socket: Operation not permitted

The ``drop-caps`` option will also accept the case insensitive keyword ``all``
as an option to drop all capabilities when entering the container.


``--security``
==============

The ``--security`` flag allows the root user to leverage security modules such
as SELinux, AppArmor, and seccomp within your Singularity container. You can
also change the UID and GID of the user within the container at runtime.

For instance:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo whoami
    root

    $ sudo singularity exec --security uid:1000 my_container.sif whoami
    david

To use seccomp to blacklist a command follow this procedure. (It is actually
preferable from a security standpoint to whitelist commands but this will
suffice for a simple example.)  Note that this example was run on Ubuntu and
that Singularity was installed with the ``libseccomp-dev`` and ``pkg-config``
packages as dependencies.

First write a configuration file.  An example configuration file is installed
with Singularity, normally at ``/usr/local/etc/singularity/seccomp-profiles/default.json``.
For this example, we will use a much simpler configuration file to blacklist the
``mkdir`` command.

.. code-block:: none

    {
        "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
        "archMap": [
            {
                "architecture": "SCMP_ARCH_X86_64",
                "subArchitectures": [
                    "SCMP_ARCH_X86",
                    "SCMP_ARCH_X32"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "syscalls": [
            {
                "names": [
                    "mkdir"
                ],
                "action": "SCMP_ACT_KILL",
                "args": [],
                "comment": "",
                "includes": {},
                "excludes": {}
            }
        ]
    }

We'll save the file at ``/home/david/no_mkdir.json``. Then we can invoke the
container like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity shell --security seccomp:/home/david/no_mkdir.json my_container.sif

    Singularity> mkdir /tmp/foo
    Bad system call (core dumped)

Note that attempting to use the blacklisted ``mkdir`` command resulted in a
core dump.

The full list of arguments accepted by the ``--security`` option are as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    --security="seccomp:/usr/local/etc/singularity/seccomp-profiles/default.json"
    --security="apparmor:/usr/bin/man"
    --security="selinux:context"
    --security="uid:1000"
    --security="gid:1000"
    --security="gid:1000:1:0" (multiple gids, first is always the primary group)
