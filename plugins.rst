--------
Overview
--------

A {Singularity} plugin is a package that can be dynamically loaded by the
{Singularity} runtime, augmenting {Singularity} with experimental, non-standard
and/or vendor-specific functionality. Currently, plugins are able to add
commands and flags to {Singularity}. In the future, plugins will also be able to
interface with more complex subsystems of the {Singularity} runtime.

-------------
Using Plugins
-------------

The ``list`` command prints the currently installed plugins.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity plugin list
    There are no plugins installed.

Plugins are packaged and distributed as binaries encoded with the versatile
Singularity Image Format (SIF). However, plugin authors may also distribute the
source code of their plugins. A plugin can be compiled from its source code
with the ``compile`` command. A sample plugin ``test-plugin`` is included with
the {Singularity} source code.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity plugin compile examples/plugins/test-plugin/

Upon successful compilation, a SIF file will appear in the directory of the
plugin's source code.

.. code-block:: none

    $ ls examples/plugins/test-plugin/ | grep sif
    test-plugin.sif

.. note::

    Currently, **all** plugins must be compiled from the {Singularity} source
    code tree.

    Also, the plugins mechanism for the Go language that {Singularity} is written
    in is quite restrictive - it requires extremely close version matching of
    packages used in a plugin to the ones used in the program the plugin is
    built for. Additionally {Singularity} is using build time config to get the
    source tree location for ``singularity plugin compile`` so that you don't
    need to export environment variables etc, and there isn't mismatch between
    package path information that Go uses.  This means that at present you must:

    * Build plugins using the exact same version of the source code, in the
      same location, as was used to build the {Singularity} executable.
    * Use the exact same version of Go that was used to build the executable
      when compiling a plugin for it.

Every plugin encapsulates various information such as the plugin's author, the
plugin's version, etc. To view this information about a plugin, use the
``inspect`` command.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity plugin inspect examples/plugins/test-plugin/test-plugin.sif
    Name: sylabs.io/test-plugin
    Description: This is a short test plugin for {Singularity}
    Author: Michael Bauer
    Version: 0.0.1

To install a plugin, use the ``install`` command. This operation requires root
privilege.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity plugin install examples/plugins/test-plugin/test-plugin.sif
    $ singularity plugin list
    ENABLED  NAME
        yes  sylabs.io/test-plugin

After successful installation, the plugin will automatically be enabled. Any
plugin can be disabled with the ``disable`` command and re-enabled with the
``enable`` command. Both of these operations require root privilege.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity plugin disable sylabs.io/test-plugin
    $ singularity plugin list
    ENABLED  NAME
         no  sylabs.io/test-plugin
    $ sudo singularity plugin enable sylabs.io/test-plugin
    $ singularity plugin list
    ENABLED  NAME
        yes  sylabs.io/test-plugin

Finally, to uninstall a plugin, use the ``uninstall`` command. This operation
requires root privilege.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity plugin uninstall sylabs.io/test-plugin
    Uninstalled plugin "sylabs.io/test-plugin".
    $ singularity plugin list
    There are no plugins installed.

----------------
Writing a Plugin
----------------

Developers interested in writing {Singularity} plugins can get started by reading
the `Go documentation
<https://godoc.org/github.com/sylabs/singularity/pkg/plugin>`_ for the plugin
package. Furthermore, reading through the `source code
<https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/tree/master/examples/plugins>`_
for the example plugins will prove valuable. More detailed plugin
development documentation is in the works and will be released at a future
date.
