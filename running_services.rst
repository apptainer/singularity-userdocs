Running Services
================

There are :ref:`different ways <runcontainer>`  in which you can run apptainer
containers. If you use commands like ``run``, ``exec`` and ``shell`` to
interact with processes in the container, you are running apptainer containers
in the foreground. apptainer, also lets you run containers in a "detached" or
"daemon" mode which can run different services in the background. A "service" is
essentially a process running in the background that multiple different clients
can use. For example, a web server or a database. To run services in a
apptainer container one should use *instances*. A container instance is a
persistent and isolated version of the container image that runs in the
background.

------------------------
Overview
------------------------

.. _sec:instances:

apptainer v2.4 introduced the concept of *instances* allowing users to run
services in apptainer. This page will help you understand instances using an
elementary example followed by a more useful example running an NGINX web server
using instances. In the end, you will find a more detailed example of running an
instance of an API that converts URL to PDFs.

To begin with, suppose you want to run an NGINX web server outside of a
container. On Ubuntu, you can simply install NGINX and start the service by:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nginx

    $ sudo service nginx start

If you were to do something like this from within a container you would also see
the service start, and the web server running. But then if you were to exit the
container, the process would continue to run within an unreachable mount
namespace. The process would still be running, but you couldn't easily kill or
interface with it. This is a called an orphan process. apptainer instances
give you the ability to handle services properly.

----------------------------------
Container Instances in apptainer
----------------------------------

For demonstration, let's use an easy (though somewhat useless) example of
`alpine_latest.sif <https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/_container/5baba5e594feb900016ea41c>`_
image from the `container library <https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/>`_:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer pull library://alpine

The above command will save the alpine image from the Container Library as
``alpine_latest.sif``.

To start an instance, you should follow this procedure :

.. code-block:: none

    [command]                      [image]              [name of instance]

    $ apptainer instance start   alpine_latest.sif     instance1

This command causes apptainer to create an isolated environment for the
container services to live inside. One can confirm that an instance is running
by using the ``instance list`` command like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer instance list

    INSTANCE NAME    PID      IP              IMAGE
    instance1        22084                    /home/dave/instances/alpine_latest.sif

.. note::
    The instances are linked with your user account. So make sure to run *all*
    instance commands either with or without the ``sudo`` privilege. If you
    ``start`` an instance with sudo then you must ``list`` it with sudo as
    well, or you will not be able to locate the instance.

If you want to run multiple instances from the same image, it’s as simple as
running the command multiple times with different instance names. The instance
name uniquely identify instances, so they cannot be repeated.

.. code-block:: none

      $ apptainer instance start alpine_latest.sif instance2

      $ apptainer instance start alpine_latest.sif instance3

And again to confirm that the instances are running as we expected:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer instance list

    INSTANCE NAME    PID      IP              IMAGE
    instance1        22084                    /home/dave/instances/alpine_latest.sif
    instance2        22443                    /home/dave/instances/alpine_latest.sif
    instance3        22493                    /home/dave/instances/alpine_latest.sif

You can also filter the instance list by supplying a pattern:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer instance list '*2'
    
    INSTANCE NAME    PID      IP              IMAGE
    instance2        22443                    /home/dave/instances/alpine_latest.s


You can use the ``apptainer run/exec`` commands on instances:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer run instance://instance1

    $ apptainer exec instance://instance2 cat /etc/os-release

When using ``run`` with an instance URI, the ``runscript`` will be executed
inside of the instance. Similarly with ``exec``, it will execute the given
command in the instance.

If you want to poke around inside of your instance, you can do a normal
``apptainer shell`` command, but give it the instance URI:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer shell instance://instance3

    apptainer>

When you are finished with your instance you can clean it up with the
``instance stop`` command as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer instance stop instance1

If you have multiple instances running and you want to stop all of them, you can
do so with a wildcard or the --all flag. The following three commands are all
identical.

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer instance stop \*

    $ apptainer instance stop --all

    $ apptainer instance stop -a

.. note::
    Note that you must escape the wildcard with a backslash like this ``\*`` to
    pass it properly.

----------------------------------
Nginx “Hello-world” in apptainer
----------------------------------

The above example, although not very useful, should serve as a fair introduction
to the concept of apptainer instances and running services in the background.
The following illustrates a more useful example of setting up a sample NGINX web
server using instances. First we will create a basic
:ref:`definition file <definition-files>` (let's call it nginx.def):

.. code-block:: apptainer

    Bootstrap: docker
    From: nginx
    Includecmd: no

    %startscript
       nginx


This downloads the official NGINX Docker container, converts it to a apptainer
image, and tells it to run NGINX when you start the instance. Since we’re
running a web server, we’re going to run the following commands as root.

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apptainer build nginx.sif nginx.def

    $ sudo apptainer instance start --writable-tmpfs nginx.sif web

.. note::
    The above ``start`` command requires ``sudo`` because we are running a web
    server. Also, to let the instance write temporary files during execution,
    you should use ``--writable-tmpfs`` while starting the instance.

Just like that we’ve downloaded, built, and run an NGINX apptainer
image. And to confirm that it’s correctly running:

.. code-block:: none

    $ curl localhost

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>

         margin: 0 auto;

     }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>

--------------------
Putting all together
--------------------

In this section, we will demonstrate an example of packaging a service into a
container and running it. The service we will be packaging is an API server that
converts a web page into a PDF, and can be found `here
<https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api>`__. You can build the image by
following the steps described below or you can just download the final image
directly from Container Library, simply run:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer pull url-to-pdf.sif library://sylabs/doc-examples/url-to-pdf:latest

Building the image
==================

This section will describe the requirements for creating the definition file
(url-to-pdf.def) that will be used to build the container image.
``url-to-pdf-api`` is based on a Node 8 server that uses a headless version of
Chromium called `Puppeteer <https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer>`_.
Let’s first choose a base from which to build our container, in this case the
docker image ``node:8`` which comes pre-installed with Node 8 has been used:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    Bootstrap: docker
    From: node:8
    Includecmd: no


Puppeteer also requires a slew of dependencies to be manually installed in
addition to Node 8, so we can add those into the ``post`` section as well as the
installation script for the ``url-to-pdf``:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    %post

        apt-get update && apt-get install -yq gconf-service libasound2 \
            libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 \
            libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 \
            libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 \
            libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 \
            libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 \
            libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates \
            fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils \
            wget curl && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*
        git clone https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api.git pdf_server
        cd pdf_server
        npm install
        chmod -R 0755 .

And now we need to define what happens when we start an instance of the
container. In this situation, we want to run the commands that starts up the
url-to-pdf service:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    %startscript
        cd /pdf_server
        # Use nohup and /dev/null to completely detach server process from terminal
        nohup npm start > /dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &


Also, the ``url-to-pdf`` service requires some environment variables to be set,
which we can do in the environment section:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    %environment
        NODE_ENV=development
        PORT=9000
        ALLOW_HTTP=true
        URL=localhost
        export NODE_ENV PORT ALLOW_HTTP URL

The complete definition file will look like this:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    Bootstrap: docker
    From: node:8
    Includecmd: no

    %post

        apt-get update && apt-get install -yq gconf-service libasound2 \
            libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 \
            libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 \
            libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 \
            libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 \
            libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 \
            libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates \
            fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils \
            wget curl && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*
        git clone https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api.git pdf_server
        cd pdf_server
        npm install
        chmod -R 0755 .

    %startscript
        cd /pdf_server
        # Use nohup and /dev/null to completely detach server process from terminal
        nohup npm start > /dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &

    %environment
        NODE_ENV=development
        PORT=9000
        ALLOW_HTTP=true
        URL=localhost
        export NODE_ENV PORT ALLOW_HTTP URL

The container can be built like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apptainer build url-to-pdf.sif url-to-pdf.def


Running the Service
===================

We can now start an instance and run the service:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apptainer instance start url-to-pdf.sif pdf

.. note::
    If there occurs an error related to port connection being refused while
    starting the instance or while using it later, you can try specifying
    different port numbers in the ``%environment`` section of the definition
    file above.

We can confirm it’s working by sending the server an http request using
curl:

.. code-block:: none

    $ curl -o sylabs.pdf localhost:9000/api/render?url=http://sylabs.io/docs

    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                             Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

    100 73750  100 73750    0     0  14583      0  0:00:05  0:00:05 --:--:-- 19130

You should see a PDF file being generated like the one shown below:

.. image:: docpage.png
    :alt: Screenshot of the PDF generated!


If you shell into the instance, you can see the running processes:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apptainer shell instance://pdf
    apptainer: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

    apptainer final.sif:/home/ysub> ps auxf
    USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND

    apptainer final.sif:/home/ysub> exit


Making it Fancy
===============

Now that we have confirmation that the server is working, let’s make it a little
cleaner. It’s difficult to remember the exact ``curl`` command and URL syntax
each time you want to request a PDF, so let’s automate it. To do that, we can
use Scientific Filesystem (SCIF) apps, that are integrated
directly into apptainer. If you haven’t already, check out the `Scientific
Filesystem documentation <https://sci-f.github.io/>`_ to come up to speed.

First off, we’re going to move the installation of the url-to-pdf into an app,
so that there is a designated spot to place output files. To do that, we want to
add a section to our definition file to build the server:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    %appinstall pdf_server
        git clone https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api.git pdf_server
        cd pdf_server
        npm install
        chmod -R 0755 .


And update our ``startscript`` to point to the app location:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    %startscript
        cd /scif/apps/pdf_server/scif/pdf_server
        # Use nohup and /dev/null to completely detach server process from terminal
        nohup npm start > /dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &


Now we want to define the pdf_client app, which we will run to send the requests
to the server:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    %apprun pdf_client
        if [ -z "${1:-}" ]; then
            echo "Usage: apptainer run --app pdf <instance://name> <URL> [output file]"
            exit 1
        fi
        curl -o "${apptainer_APPDATA}/output/${2:-output.pdf}" "${URL}:${PORT}/api/render?url=${1}"


As you can see, the ``pdf_client`` app checks to make sure that the user
provides at least one argument.

The full def file will look like this:

.. code-block:: apptainer

    Bootstrap: docker
    From: node:8
    Includecmd: no

    %post

        apt-get update && apt-get install -yq gconf-service libasound2 \
            libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 \
            libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 \
            libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 \
            libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 \
            libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 \
            libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates \
            fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils \
            wget curl && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    %appinstall pdf_server
        git clone https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api.git pdf_server
        cd pdf_server
        npm install
        chmod -R 0755 .

    %startscript
        cd /scif/apps/pdf_server/scif/pdf_server
        # Use nohup and /dev/null to completely detach server process from terminal
        nohup npm start > /dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &

    %environment
        NODE_ENV=development
        PORT=9000
        ALLOW_HTTP=true
        URL=localhost
        export NODE_ENV PORT ALLOW_HTTP URL

    %apprun pdf_client
        if [ -z "${1:-}" ]; then
            echo "Usage: apptainer run --app pdf <instance://name> <URL> [output file]"
            exit 1
        fi
        curl -o "${apptainer_APPDATA}/output/${2:-output.pdf}" "${URL}:${PORT}/api/render?url=${1}"

Create the container as before. The ``--force`` option will overwrite the old
container:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apptainer build --force url-to-pdf.sif url-to-pdf.def

Now that we have an output directory in the container, we need to expose it to
the host using a bind mount. Once we’ve rebuilt the container, make a new
directory called ``/tmp/out`` for the generated PDFs to go.

.. code-block:: none

    $ mkdir /tmp/out

After building the image from the edited definition file we simply start the
instance:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer instance start --bind /tmp/out/:/output url-to-pdf.sif pdf

To request a pdf simply do:

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer run --app pdf_client instance://pdf http://sylabs.io/docs sylabs.pdf

To confirm that it worked:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ls /tmp/out/
    sylabs.pdf

When you are finished, use the instance stop command to close all running
instances.

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer instance stop --all

.. note::
    If the service you want to run in your instance requires a bind mount,
    then you must pass the ``--bind`` option when calling ``instance start``.
    For example, if you wish to capture the output of the ``web`` container
    instance which is placed at ``/output/`` inside the container you could do:

    .. code-block:: none

        $ apptainer instance start --bind output/dir/outside/:/output/ nginx.sif  web


------------------------------
System integration / PID files
------------------------------

If you are running services in containers you may want them to be started on
boot, and shutdown gracefully automatically. This is usually performed by an init process,
or another supervisor daemon installed on your host. Many init and supervisor
daemons support managing processes via pid files.

You can specify a `--pid-file` option to `apptainer instance start` to write
the PID for an instance to the specifed file, e.g.

.. code-block:: none

    $ apptainer instance start --pid-file /home/dave/alpine.pid alpine_latest.sif instanceA

    $ cat /home/dave/alpine.pid
    23727


An example service file for an instance controlled by systemd is below. This can be used as a
template to setup containerized services under systemd.

.. code-block:: none

    [Unit]
    Description=Web Instance
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    Restart=always
    User=www-data
    Group=www-data
    PIDFile=/run/web-instance.pid
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/apptainer instance start --pid-file /run/web-instance.pid /data/containers/web.sif web-instance
    ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/apptainer instance stop web-instance

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Note that ``Type=forking`` is required here, since ``instance start`` starts an instance and then exits.
