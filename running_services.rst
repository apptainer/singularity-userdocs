Running Services
================

Singularity 2.4 introduces the ability to run “container instances”,
allowing you to run services (e.g. Nginx, MySQL, etc…) using
Singularity. A container instance, simply put, is a persistent and
isolated version of the container image that runs in the background.

------------------------
Why container instances?
------------------------

.. _sec:instances: Let’s say I want to run a web server. With nginx,
that is pretty simple, I install nginx and start the service:

.. code-block:: none

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx

    service nginx start

With older versions of Singularity, if you were to do something like
this, from inside the container you would happily see the service
start, and the web server running! But then if you were to log out of
the container what would happen?
Orphan process within unreachable namespaces!
You would lose control of the process. It would still be running, but
you couldn’t easily kill or interface with it. This is a called an
orphan process. Singularity versions less than 2.4 were not designed to handle running services properly.

----------------------------------
Container Instances in Singularity
----------------------------------

With Singularity 2.4 and the addition of container instances, the
ability to cleanly, reliably, and safely run services in a container is
here. First, let’s put some commands that we want our instance to
execute into a script. Let’s call it a ``startscript``. This fits into a definition
file like so:

.. code-block:: none

    %startscript


    service nginx start

Now let’s say we build a container with that startscript into an image
called ``nginx.img`` and we want to run an nginx service. All we need to do is start
the instance with the :ref:`instance.start <instance-start>` command, and the
startscript will run inside the container automatically:

.. code-block:: none

                  [command]        [image]    [name of instance]

    $ singularity instance.start   nginx.img  web

When we run that command, Singularity creates an isolated environment
for the container instances’ processes/services to live inside. We can
confirm that this command started an instance by running the
instance.list command like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.list

    INSTANCE NAME    PID      CONTAINER IMAGE

    web              790      /home/mibauer/nginx.img


If we want to run multiple instances from the same image, it’s as simple
as running the command multiple times. The instance names are an
identifier used to uniquely describe an instance, so they cannot be
repeated.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.start   nginx.img  web1

    $ singularity instance.start   nginx.img  web2

    $ singularity instance.start   nginx.img  web3


And again to confirm that the instances are running as we expected:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.list

    INSTANCE NAME    PID      CONTAINER IMAGE

    web1             790      /home/mibauer/nginx.img

    web2             791      /home/mibauer/nginx.img

    web3             792      /home/mibauer/nginx.img


If the service you want to run in your instance requires a bind mount,
then you must pass the ``-B`` option when calling ``instance.start``. For example, if you wish to
capture the output of the ``web1`` container instance which is placed at ``/output/`` inside
the container you could do:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.start -B output/dir/outside/:/output/ nginx.img  web1

If you want to poke around inside of your instance, you can do a normal ``singularity shell``
command, but give it the instance URI:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell instance://web1

    Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...


    Singularity pdf_server.img:~/>


Similarly, you can use the ``singularity run/exec`` commands on instances:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity run instance://web1

    $ singularity exec instance://web1 ps -ef


When using ``run`` with an instance URI, the ``runscript`` will be executed inside of the
instance. Similarly with ``exec``, it will execute the given command in the
instance.

When you are finished with your instance you can clean it up with the
:ref:`instance.stop <instance-stop>` command like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.stop web1

If you have multiple instances running and you want to stop all of
them, you can do so with a wildcard or the -a flag:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.stop \*

    $ singularity instance.stop -a


.. note::
    Note that you must escape the wildcard with a backslash like this ``\*`` to
    pass it properly.

----------------------------------
Nginx “Hello-world” in Singularity
----------------------------------

Let’s take a look at setting up a sample nginx web server using
instances in Singularity. First we will just create a basic definition
file:

.. code-block:: none

    Bootstrap: docker

    From: nginx

    Includecmd: no


    %startscript

        nginx


All this does is download the official nginx Docker container, convert
it to a Singularity image, and tell it to run nginx when you start the
instance. Since we’re running a web server, we’re going to run the
following commands as root.

.. code-block:: none

    # singularity build nginx.img Singularity

    # singularity instance.start nginx.img web1


Just like that we’ve downloaded, built, and ran an nginx Singularity
image. And to confirm that it’s correctly running:

.. code-block:: none

    $ curl localhost

    127.0.0.1 - - [06/Oct/2017:21:46:43 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.47.0" "-"

--------------------
Putting all together
--------------------

In this section, we will demonstrate an example of packaging a service
into a container and running it. The service we will be packaging is an
API server that converts a web page into a PDF, and can be found
`here <https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api>`__. The final
example can be found `here on GitHub <https://github.com/bauerm97/instance-example>`_.
If you wish to just download the final image directly from Singularity
Hub, simply run ``singularity pull shub://bauerm97/instance-example``.

Building the image
==================

To begin, we need to build the image. When looking at the GitHub page of
the ``url-to-pdf-api``, we can see that it is a Node 8 server that uses headless Chromium
called `Puppeteer <https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer>`_. Let’s first choose a base from which to build our
container, in this case I used the docker image ``node:8`` which comes
pre-installed with Node 8:

.. code-block:: none

    Bootstrap: docker

    From: node:8

    Includecmd: no


| Puppeteer also requires a few dependencies to be manually installed in
  addition to Node 8, so we can add those into the ``post`` section as well as
  the installation script for the ``url-to-pdf-api``:

.. code-block:: none

    %post

         apt-get update

         apt-get install -yq gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 \

         libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 \

         libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 \

         libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 \

         libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates \

         fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils wget curl

         rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*

         cd /

         git clone https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api.git pdf_server

         cd pdf_server

         npm install

         chmod -R 0755 .


And now we need to define what happens when we start an instance of the
container. In this situation, we want to run the commands that starts up
the url-to-pdf-api server:

.. code-block:: none

    %startscript

        cd /pdf_server

        # Use nohup and /dev/null to completely detach server process from terminal

        nohup npm start > /dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &


Also, the ``url-to-pdf-api`` server requires ``environment`` some variables be set, which we can do in the
environment section:

.. code-block:: none

    %environment

        NODE_ENV=development

        PORT=8000

        ALLOW_HTTP=true

        URL=localhost

        export NODE_ENV PORT ALLOW_HTTP URL


Now we can build the definition file into an image! Simply run ``build`` and the
image will be ready to go:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo singularity build url-to-pdf-api.img Singularity

Running the Server
==================

Now that we have an image, we are ready to start an instance and run the
server:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.start url-to-pdf-api.img pdf

We can confirm it’s working by sending the server an http request using
curl:

.. code-block:: none

    $ curl -o google.pdf localhost:8000/api/render?url=http://google.com

      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

    100 51664  100 51664    0     0  12443      0  0:00:04  0:00:04 --:--:-- 12446


If you shell into the instance, you can see the running processes:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity shell instance://pdf

    LICENSE  README.md  Singularity  out  pdf_server.img

    Singularity pdf_server.img:~/bauerm97/instance-example> exit


Making it Pretty
================

Now that we have confirmation that the server is working, let’s make
it a little cleaner. It’s difficult to remember the exact curl command
and URL syntax each time you want to request a PDF, so let’s automate
that. To do that, we’re going to be using Standard Container
Integration Format (SCIF) apps, which are integrated directly into
singularity. If you haven’t already, check out the :ref:`Singularity app documentation <reproducible-scif-apps>` to come up to
speed.

First off, we’re going to move the installation of the url-to-pdf-api
into an app, so that there is a designated spot to place output files.
To do that, we want to add a section to our definition file to build
the server:

.. code-block:: none

    %appinstall pdf_server

        git clone https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api.git pdf_server

        cd pdf_server

        npm install

        chmod -R 0755 .


And update our ``startscript`` to point to the app location:

.. code-block:: none

    %startscript

        cd "${APPROOT_pdf_server}/pdf_server"

        # Use nohup and /dev/null to completely detach server process from terminal

        nohup npm start > /dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &


Now we want to define the pdf\_client app, which we will run to send the
requests to the server:

.. code-block:: none

    %apprun pdf_client

        if [ -z "${1:-}" ]; then

            echo "Usage: singularity run --app pdf <instance://name> <URL> [output file]"

            exit 1

        fi

        curl -o "${SINGULARITY_APPDATA}/output/${2:-output.pdf}" "${URL}:${PORT}/api/render?url=${1}"


As you can see, the ``pdf_client`` app checks to make sure that the user provides at
least one argument. Now that we have an output directory in the
container, we need to expose it to the host using a bind mount. Once
we’ve rebuilt the container, make a new directory callout ``out`` for the
generated PDF’s to go. Now we simply start the instance like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.start -B out/:/scif/data/pdf_client/output/ url-to-pdf-api.img pdf

And to request a pdf simply do:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity run --app pdf_client instance://pdf http://google.com google.pdf

And to confirm that it worked:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ls out/

    google.pdf

When you are finished, use the instance.stop command to close all
running instances.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity instance.stop \*

---------------
Important Notes
---------------

.. note.. code-block:: none
    The instances are linked with your user. So if you start an instance
    with sudo, that is going to go under root, and you will need to call ``sudo singularity instance.list``
    in order to see it.
