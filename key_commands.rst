Singularity 3.2 introduces the abilities to import, export and remove PGP keys following the OpenPGP standard via `GnuPGP (GPG) <https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html>`_.
These commands only modify the local keyring and are not related to the cloud keystore.

.. _key_import:

--------------------------
Changes in Singularity 3.7
--------------------------

Singularity 3.7 introduces a global keyring which can be managed by administrators with the new ``--global`` option.
This global keyring is used by ECL (https://sylabs.io/guides/\{adminversion\}/admin-guide/configfiles.html#ecl-toml)
and allows administrators to manage public keys used during ECL image verification.

------------------
Key import command
------------------

Singularity 3.2 allows you import keys reading either from binary or armored key format and automatically detect if it is a private or public key and add it to the correspondent local keystore.

To give a quick view on how it works, we will first consider the case in which a user wants to import a secret (private) key to the local keystore.

First we will check what's the status of the local keystore (which keys are stored by the moment before importing a new key).

.. code-block:: Singularity

  $ singularity key list --secret

.. note::

  Remember that using ``--secret`` flag or ``-s`` flag will return the secret or private local keyring as output.

The output will look as it follows:

.. code-block:: Singularity

.. note::

    Remember that running that same command but with sudo privilege, will give you a totally different list since it will be the correspondent keystore from user ``root``

After this, you can simply import the key you need by adding the exact location to the file, let's say you own a gpg key file named ``pinkie-pie.asc`` which is a secret GPG key you want to import.
Then you will just need to run the following command to import your key:

.. code-block:: Singularity

  $ singularity key import $HOME/pinkie-pie.asc

.. note::
  This location is considering your key was located on the ``$HOME`` directory. You can specify any location to the file.

Since you're importing a private (secret) key, you will need to specify the passphrase related to it and then a new passphrase to be added on your local keystore.

.. code-block:: Singularity

    Enter your old password :
    Enter a new password for this key :
    Retype your passphrase :
    Key with fingerprint 8C10B902F438E4D504C3ACF689FCFFAED5F34A77 successfully added to the keyring

After this you can see if that key was correctly added to your local keystore by running ``singularity key list -s`` command:


.. code-block:: Singularity

You will see the imported key at the bottom of the list. Remember you can also import an ``ascii`` armored key and this will be automatically detected by the ``key import`` command (no need to specify the format).

.. note::

  In case you would like to import a public key the process remains the same, as the import command will automatically detect whether this key to be imported is either public or private.

.. _key_export:

------------------
Key export command
------------------

The key export command allows you to export a key that is on your local keystore. This key could be either private or public, and the key can be exported on ``ASCII`` armored format or on binary format.
Of course to identify the keystore and the format the syntax varies from the ``key import`` command.

For example to export a public key in binary format you can run:

.. code-block:: Singularity

    $ singularity key export 8C10B902F438E4D504C3ACF689FCFFAED5F34A77 $HOME/mykey.asc

This will export a public binary key named ``mykey.asc`` and will save it under the home folder. If you would like to export the same public key but in an ``ASCII`` armored format, you would need to run the following command:

.. code-block:: Singularity

    $ singularity key export --armor 8C10B902F438E4D504C3ACF689FCFFAED5F34A77 $HOME/mykey.asc

And in the case in which you may need to export a secret key on ``ASCII`` armored format, you would need to specify from where to find the key, since the fingerprint is the same.

.. code-block:: Singularity

    $ singularity key export --armor --secret 8C10B902F438E4D504C3ACF689FCFFAED5F34A77 $HOME/mykey.asc

and on binary format instead:

.. code-block:: Singularity

    $ singularity key export --secret 8C10B902F438E4D504C3ACF689FCFFAED5F34A77 $HOME/mykey.asc

.. note::

    Exporting keys will not change the status of your local keystore or keyring. This will just obtain the content of the keys and save it on a local file on your host.

.. _key_remove:

------------------
Key remove command
------------------

In case you would want to remove a public key from your public local keystore, you can do so by running the following command:

.. code-block:: Singularity

    $ singularity key remove 8C10B902F438E4D504C3ACF689FCFFAED5F34A77

.. note::

    Remember that this will only delete the public key and not the private one with the same matching fingerprint.
