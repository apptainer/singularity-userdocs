Build Modules
-------------

.. _build-library-module:


``library`` bootstrap agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _sec:build-library-module:


Overview
""""""""

You can use an existing container on the Container Library as your “base,” and
then add customization. This allows you to build multiple images from the same
starting point. For example, you may want to build several containers with the
same custom python installation, the same custom compiler toolchain, or the same
base MPI installation. Instead of building these from scratch each time, you
could create a base container on the Container Library and then build new
containers from that existing base container adding customizations in ``%post``,
``%environment``, ``%runscript``, etc.

Keywords
""""""""

.. code-block:: singularity

    Bootstrap: library

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap module to
use.

.. code-block:: singularity

    From: <entity>/<collection>/<container>:<tag>

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the container to use as a base.
``entity`` is optional and defaults to ``library``. ``collection`` is
optional and defaults to ``default``. This is the correct namespace to use for
some official containers (``alpine`` for example). ``tag`` is also optional and
will default to ``latest``.

.. code-block:: singularity

    Library: http://custom/library

The Library keyword is optional. It will default to
``https://library.sylabs.io``.


.. _build-docker-module:


``docker`` bootstrap agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _sec:build-docker-module:


Overview
""""""""

Docker images are comprised of layers that are assembled at runtime to create an
image. You can use Docker layers to create a base image, and then add your own
custom software. For example, you might use Docker’s Ubuntu image layers to
create an Ubuntu Singularity container. You could do the same with CentOS,
Debian, Arch, Suse, Alpine, BusyBox, etc.

Or maybe you want a container that already has software installed. For instance,
maybe you want to build a container that uses CUDA and cuDNN to leverage the
GPU, but you don’t want to install from scratch. You can start with one of the
``nvidia/cuda`` containers and install your software on top of that.

Or perhaps you have already invested in Docker and created your own Docker
containers. If so, you can seamlessly convert them to Singularity with the
``docker`` bootstrap module.


Keywords
""""""""

.. code-block:: singularity

    Bootstrap: docker

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap module to
use.

.. code-block:: singularity

    From: <registry>/<namespace>/<container>:<tag>@<digest>

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the container to use as a base.
``registry`` is optional and defaults to ``index.docker.io``. ``namespace`` is
optional and defaults to ``library``. This is the correct namespace to use for
some official containers (ubuntu for example). ``tag`` is also optional and will
default to ``latest``

See :ref:`Singularity and Docker <singularity-and-docker>` for more detailed
info on using Docker registries.

.. code-block:: singularity

    Registry: http://custom_registry

The Registry keyword is optional. It will default to ``index.docker.io``.

.. code-block:: singularity

    Namespace: namespace

The Namespace keyword is optional. It will default to ``library``.

.. code-block:: singularity

    IncludeCmd: yes

The IncludeCmd keyword is optional. If included, and if a ``%runscript`` is not
specified, a Docker ``CMD`` will take precedence over ``ENTRYPOINT`` and will be
used as a runscript. Note that the ``IncludeCmd`` keyword is considered valid if
it is not empty! This means that ``IncludeCmd: yes`` and ``IncludeCmd: no`` are
identical. In both cases the ``IncludeCmd`` keyword is not empty, so the Docker
``CMD`` will take precedence over an ``ENTRYPOINT``.

 See :ref:`Singularity and Docker <singularity-and-docker>` for more info on
 order of operations for determining a runscript.

Notes
"""""

Docker containers are stored as a collection of tarballs called layers. When
building from a Docker container the layers must be downloaded and then
assembled in the proper order to produce a viable file system. Then the file
system must be converted to Singularity Image File (sif) format.

Building from Docker Hub is not considered reproducible because if any of the
layers of the image are changed, the container will change. If reproducibility
is important to your workflow, consider hosting a base container on the
Container Library and building from it instead.

For detailed information about setting your build environment see
:ref:`Build Customization <build-environment>`.

.. _build-shub:


``shub`` bootstrap agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overview
""""""""

You can use an existing container on Singularity Hub as your “base,” and then
add customization. This allows you to build multiple images from the same
starting point. For example, you may want to build several containers with the
same custom python installation, the same custom compiler toolchain, or the same
base MPI installation. Instead of building these from scratch each time, you

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap module to
use.

.. code-block:: singularity

    From: shub://<registry>/<username>/<container-name>:<tag>@digest

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the container to use as a base.
``registry is optional and defaults to ``singularity-hub.org``. ``tag`` and
``digest`` are also optional. ``tag`` defaults to ``latest`` and ``digest`` can
be left blank if you want the latest build.

Notes
"""""

When bootstrapping from a Singularity Hub image, all previous definition files
that led to the creation of the current image will be stored in a directory
within the container called ``/.singularity.d/bootstrap_history``. Singularity
will also alert you if environment variables have been changed between the base
image and the new image during bootstrap.

.. _build-oras:


``oras`` bootstrap agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overview
""""""""

Using, this module, a container from supporting OCI Registries - Eg: ACR (Azure Container 
Registry), local container registries, etc can be used as your “base” image and later 
customized. This allows you to build multiple images from the same starting point. For 
example, you may want to build several containers with the same custom python installation, 
the same custom compiler toolchain, or the same base MPI installation. Instead of 
building these from scratch each time, you could make use of ``oras`` to pull an 
appropriate base container and then build new containers by adding customizations in 
``%post`` , ``%environment``, ``%runscript``, etc.

.. code-block:: singularity

    Bootstrap: oras

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap module to

.. code-block:: singularity

    From: oras://registry/namespace/image:tag

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the container to use as a base.
Also,``tag`` is mandatory that refers to the version of image you want to use.

.. _build-localimage:


``localimage`` bootstrap agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``From`` keyword is mandatory. It specifies the local container to use as a
base.

Notes
"""""

When building from a local container, all previous definition files that led to
the creation of the current container will be stored in a directory within the
container called ``/.singularity.d/bootstrap_history``. Singularity will also

the new image during bootstrap.

.. _build-yum:


``yum`` bootstrap agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _sec:build-yum:

This module allows you to build a Red Hat/CentOS/Scientific Linux style
container from a mirror URI.

Overview
""""""""

Use the ``yum`` module to specify a base for a CentOS-like container. You must
also specify the URI for the mirror you would like to use.

""""""""

.. code-block:: singularity

    Bootstrap: yum

The Bootstrap keyword is always mandatory. It describes the bootstrap module to
use.

.. code-block:: singularity

    OSVersion: 7

The OSVersion keyword is optional. It specifies the OS version you would like to
use. It is only required if you have specified a %{OSVERSION} variable in the
``MirrorURL`` keyword.

.. code-block:: singularity

    MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/

The MirrorURL keyword is mandatory. It specifies the URI to use as a mirror to
download the OS. If you define the ``OSVersion`` keyword, then you can use it in
the URI as in the example above.

.. code-block:: singularity

    Include: yum

The Include keyword is optional. It allows you to install additional packages
into the core operating system. It is a best practice to supply only the bare
essentials such that the ``%post`` section has what it needs to properly
complete the build. One common package you may want to install when using the
``yum`` build module is YUM itself.

Notes
"""""

There is a major limitation with using YUM to bootstrap a container. The RPM
database that exists within the container will be created using the RPM library
and Berkeley DB implementation that exists on the host system. If the RPM
implementation inside the container is not compatible with the RPM database that
was used to create the container, RPM and YUM commands inside the container may
fail. This issue can be easily demonstrated by bootstrapping an older RHEL
compatible image by a newer one (e.g. bootstrap a Centos 5 or 6 container from a
Centos 7 host).

In order to use the ``yum`` build module, you must have ``yum``
installed on your system. It may seem counter-intuitive to install YUM on a
system that uses a different package manager, but you can do so. For instance,
on Ubuntu you can install it like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yum

.. _build-debootstrap:

The OSVersion keyword is mandatory. It specifies the OS version you would like
to use. For Ubuntu you can use code words like ``trusty`` (14.04), ``xenial``
(16.04), and ``yakkety`` (17.04). For Debian you can use values like ``stable``,
``oldstable``, ``testing``, and ``unstable`` or code words like ``wheezy`` (7),
``jesse`` (8), and ``stretch`` (9).

The Arch Linux bootstrap module does not name any additional keywords at this
time. By defining the ``arch`` module, you have essentially given all of the
information necessary for that particular bootstrap module to build a core
operating system.

.. _docker-daemon-archive:

``docker-daemon`` and ``docker-archive`` bootstrap agents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using docker locally there are two options for creating Singularity
images without the need for a repository. You can either build a SIF from a 
``docker-save`` tar file or you can convert any docker image present in 
docker's daemon internal storage.


Overview

The ``docker-daemon`` bootstrap agent can be used in a Singularity definition file 
as follows:

.. code-block:: singularity

    From: docker-daemon:<image>:<tag>

where both ``<image>`` and ``<tag>`` are mandatory fields that must be written explicitly.
The ``docker-archive`` bootstrap agent requires instead the path to the tar file 
containing the image:

.. code-block:: singularity

    From: docker-archive:<path-to-tar-file>

Note that differently from the ``docker://`` bootstrap agent both ``docker-daemon`` and 
``docker-archive`` don't require a double slash ``//`` after the colon in the agent name.

.. _scratch-agent:

``scratch`` bootstrap agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Through all the Bootstrap agents mentioned above, you were essentially building
over a base(parent) image pulled from either Library/Docker/Shub/Oras etc, but
Singularity offers support to create even the base images or minimal images to
create your custom containers.

Overview
""""""""

This module allows you to take full control of the content inside your container,
